            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I’m Seun Abiodun, a passionate <strong>Frontend Developer</strong>, 
                <strong>WordPress Specialist</strong>, and <strong>Digital Marketer</strong> 
                based in Nigeria. Over the last three years, I’ve been helping businesses, 
                non-profits, and startups transform their ideas into modern, responsive, 
                and user-friendly websites.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                My tech journey started with a curiosity for how websites are built. 
                From learning HTML and CSS, I advanced into JavaScript, WordPress, 
                and digital marketing. This combination allows me not only to build 
                visually appealing websites, but also to ensure they are optimised 
                for speed, SEO, and conversions. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I’ve worked on diverse projects such as educational platforms, logistics 
                websites, corporate portals, and non-profit organisations. Each project 
                sharpened my ability to understand client needs and deliver tailored solutions 
                that align with their goals.
            </p>

            <p>
                Beyond development, I’m also passionate about teaching and empowering others 
                with digital skills. I believe technology should be an enabler, and I aim 
                to contribute to the growth of a thriving digital ecosystem in Africa.
            </p>

            <p>
                When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me exploring <strong>Web3 trends</strong>, 
                improving my design skills, or learning about <strong>digital marketing strategies</strong> 
                that drive growth.
            </p>
